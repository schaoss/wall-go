When the game ends, count the squares in each player’s territory; the player with the most wins.\n\n【Equipment & Players】\n&nbsp;•&nbsp;Board: 7×7 squares\n&nbsp;•&nbsp;Players:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;2-player: Red and Blue, each with 4 pieces\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;3/4-player: Add Yellow/Light Blue, each color has 2 pieces\n&nbsp;•&nbsp;Walls: Unlimited, color-coded by player\n\n【Game Flow】\nPlacement Phase\n&nbsp;•&nbsp;2-player: Starting positions fixed: Red [1,1],[5,5]; Blue [1,5],[5,1]. The other two are placed alternately: Red, Blue, Blue, Red\n&nbsp;•&nbsp;3/4-player: Each player places 2 pieces, in alternating order (e.g. A→B→C→C→B→A)\n\nAction Phase (turn-based)\n&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Choose any of your pieces that can still act\n&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Move 0, 1, or 2 steps:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;Each step must be up, down, left, or right\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;Cannot cross or pass through walls or other pieces\n&nbsp;3.&nbsp;After moving, you must place a wall on an open side of that piece’s square (even if you moved 0 steps)\n\n【Walls & Borders】\n&nbsp;•&nbsp;The board’s outer edge counts as a wall\n&nbsp;•&nbsp;2-player: Walls cannot be removed once placed\n&nbsp;•&nbsp;3/4-player: Each player gets one “wall break” per game, usable on their turn\n\n【Time Limit】\n&nbsp;•&nbsp;90 seconds per turn\n&nbsp;•&nbsp;If time runs out, a wall is placed randomly and the turn ends\n\n【End Condition】\n&nbsp;•&nbsp;The game ends when all players’ pieces are in separate territories\n\n【Scoring】\n&nbsp;•&nbsp;Each square in a territory is worth 1 point\n&nbsp;•&nbsp;If total scores are tied, the player with the largest single territory wins\n\n【Victory】\n&nbsp;•&nbsp;Highest score wins\n&nbsp;•&nbsp;If both total and largest territory are tied, it’s a draw\n\n──&nbsp;Enjoy the game!",
